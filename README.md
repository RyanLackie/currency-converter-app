## About This Project
This application was made to play around with client to server side connections ðŸ¥³

In the app you can enter an amount and a currency, and then see the amount it is equal to in another currency using the http://exchangeratesapi.io/ api.

Down at the bottom there is a switch that will display the python or javascript icon. You can use this to switch between the 2 servers (Node and Flask) you started during setup.
