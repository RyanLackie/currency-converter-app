# Currency Converter

This applciation can be viewed at https://currency-converter-vue-app.herokuapp.com/

To run this application locally open the project and start a docker inside of the `server_js` and `server_py` directories, and then run `npm run serve`

The client side interfaces with 2 server side applciations. Both gather currency exchange rates from http://exchangeratesapi.io/ but use different languages and frameworks. The default selection is set to use Python and Flask and the secondary is JavaScript and Node.  

This app was made as a fun project to explore the connections between the app and the api.
